# Bug Fix Game :beetle:

This app was created by me and 2 other contributors as part of a project for a Javascript introductory course.
It uses basic html, CSS and Javascript.

## :question: What is it ? :question:
The main page consists of a welcome message, a quick explanation of the rules and the 4 dots at the top of the page allow you to change the color of the page.
Once you click on 'Start Game' it takes you to the first question.

You need to answer 10 questions correctly to win the game. If you make 5 mistakes you loose the game. 
There are 3 types of questions : fill-in the gap, multiple choice and correct the code snippet. 
The questions are all about Javascript. 

You will win a bug each time you answer correctly. :bug: If you change the color display during the game the bug you will get is different. 
If you make a mistake you will loose a heart. :heart:
The correct answer as well as an explanation will be displayed after you submit your answer.

Have fun! :clap:
